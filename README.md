# Javascript-Timer-Prroject
Here I have ceated a Javascript Timer project using HTML, CSS and Javascript in which the timer is set at 11th Jan 2020. You can change the date by changing the variable "newYears" in .js file.
I have tried to make this project's UI simple, clean and interactive using HTML and CSS.
