# Javascript-Timer-Prroject
Here I have ceated a Javascript Timer project using HTML, CSS and Javascript in which the timer is set at 1st Jan 2021 i.e,New Year, You can change the date by changing the variable "newYears" in .js file.
I have tried to make this project's UI simple, clean and interactive using HTML and CSS.
